## Methods

### NewSpecResponseModel

`func NewSpecResponseModel() *SpecResponseModel`

NewSpecResponseModel instantiates a new SpecResponseModel object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewSpecResponseModelWithDefaults

`func NewSpecResponseModelWithDefaults() *SpecResponseModel`

This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

GetTaints returns the Taints field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetTaintsOk
